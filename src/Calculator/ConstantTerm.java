// ConstantTerm class:
// This is for constant numbers like 5 or -3. These are terms that don't have an x (they're just plain numbers).
// The derivative of any constant is always 0 because constants don't change.
// If you evaluate it (like ask "what's 5 when x = 2?"), it'll always give you the constant itself (so, just 5).
