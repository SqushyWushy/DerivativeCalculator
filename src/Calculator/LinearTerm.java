// LinearTerm class:
// This is for terms like 5x or -3x. Basically, it's numbers that are multiplied by x.
// The derivative of something like 5x is just the number in front, so the derivative of 5x is 5.
// If you evaluate it (like for x = 2), you just multiply the number by whatever x is (so, 5 * 2 = 10).
