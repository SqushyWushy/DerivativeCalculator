// PolynomialTerm class:
// This is for terms where x has an exponent, like 4x^3 or -2x^5.
// To get the derivative, you follow the power rule. For example, for 4x^3, you bring the exponent down (3 * 4 = 12)
// and then subtract 1 from the exponent (so it becomes 12x^2).
// When you evaluate it, you just plug in the value for x and do the math (like if x = 2, you'd calculate 4 * 2^3).
