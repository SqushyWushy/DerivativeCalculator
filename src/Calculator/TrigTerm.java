// TrigTerm class:
// This handles trigonometric functions, like sin(x) or cos(x).
// The derivative follows the trig rules. For example, the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).
// When you evaluate it, you plug in a value for x and calculate the sine or cosine of that number (in radians).
