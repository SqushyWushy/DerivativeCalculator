// Expression class:
// This is where we bring all the terms together to make an entire equation, like 5x + 4x^3 - sin(x).
// It handles a few key things:
// 1. It stores all the terms in a linked list.
// 2. It can find the derivative of the whole equation by getting the derivative of each term.
// 3. It can evaluate the equation by plugging in a value for x and adding up the results of each term.
// 4. It turns the full equation into a nice string so it looks like math when printed.
